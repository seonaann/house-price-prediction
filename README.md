House Price Prediction - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains my solution to the **"House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"** . The goal is to predict the final prices of homes in Ames, Iowa based on a rich set of features.

##  Contents

- `HousePrediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with preprocessing, model training, and predictions using XGBoost.
- `train.csv` / `test.csv`: Dataset used from the competition *(not included here — available on Kaggle)*.
- `submission.csv`: Final predictions submitted to Kaggle.

##  Model Details

- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Regressor
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Imputation for missing values
  - Label encoding for categorical variables
  - Feature engineering (e.g., house age, total bathrooms)
- **Validation**:
